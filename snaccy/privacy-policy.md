# **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** July 25, 2025

Snaccy ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Snaccy mobile application ("App").

---

## **1. Information We Collect**

Snaccy is designed to be fun and simple. We **do not collect any personal information** such as your name, email, phone number, or location unless explicitly stated.

However, we may collect:

* **Anonymous Usage Data:** We may use tools like Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how users interact with the app (e.g., which features are most used), but this data is non-personal and aggregated.
* **Crash Logs & Diagnostics:** To improve app performance and fix bugs, we may collect anonymized crash reports.

---

## **2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the limited data we collect to:

* Improve app performance and user experience.
* Fix bugs and app crashes.
* Understand general usage patterns.

We **do not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or tracking you across apps or websites.

---

## **3. Data Sharing**

We do **not sell, rent, or share** your data with third parties.

We may use third-party services (such as Firebase or other analytics/crash reporting tools) that have their own privacy policies. We ensure these services are reputable and compliant.

---

## **4. Children’s Privacy**

Snaccy is intended for general audiences and is safe for all age groups. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe we’ve unintentionally collected such data, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## **5. Your Rights**

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no stored data tied to your identity. If this changes in future versions of Snaccy, we will update this policy accordingly and allow you to manage your data preferences.

---

## **6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, the new policy will be posted in the app or our official website (if available). You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
