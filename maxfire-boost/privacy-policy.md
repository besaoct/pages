# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 3, 2025**

BESAOCT ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Maxfire Boost app ("the App"), a mobile application providing legal tips and hacks for enhancing gameplay in Free Fire. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices. The App is intended for users aged 13 and older and is not directed toward children under 13. This policy complies with applicable privacy laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play Store requirements.

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 1. No Collection of Personal Information

The Maxfire Boost app does not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. Specifically:
- We do not require account creation or user registration.
- We do not collect data such as names, email addresses, device identifiers, IP addresses, or usage data.
- The App operates entirely offline, with no backend, database, or internet connectivity for data collection.
- No personal or sensitive information (e.g., race, ethnicity, health data) is collected, as the App solely provides static content like sensitivity settings and gameplay tips.

## 2. No Use or Sharing of Personal Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use or share any such data. The App functions locally on your device, and no data is transmitted to us or third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate third-party services that collect data, such as analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) or advertising networks. However:
- **Payment Processors**: If you purchase the App or access premium features via the Google Play Store, payment information is processed securely by Google Play’s payment system. We do not access, store, or process any payment details. Please refer to [Google Play’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on their data practices.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Maxfire Boost is not directed toward children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect data from users under 13. If a parent or guardian believes a child under 13 has interacted with the App in a way that concerns them, please contact us at [support@besaoct.space](mailto:support@besaoct.space), and we will address your concerns promptly, in compliance with COPPA.

## 5. Your Data Rights

As the App does not collect personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, correct, delete, or opt out of. If you have questions about the App’s functionality, you may contact us at [support@besaoct.space](mailto:support@besaoct.space).

## 6. Data Security

Since the App does not collect or store personal information, no data security measures are required for user data. The App operates locally on your device, and all content (e.g., tips and settings) is embedded within the App itself.

## 7. Pricing and In-App Purchases

Maxfire Boost may be a paid app or offer premium features through the Google Play Store. All payment transactions are handled securely by Google Play’s payment system, and we do not access or store payment information. A link to this Privacy Policy is provided during the purchase process, as required by Google Play guidelines. For details on pricing or subscriptions, refer to the App’s listing on the Google Play Store.

## 8. Accessing the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is accessible within the App under the “Settings” or “Legal” section and on our Google Play Store listing. We recommend reviewing it regularly, as it may be updated to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements.

## 9. International Users

As the App does not collect or transmit data, there are no international data transfers. The App functions identically regardless of your location, in compliance with laws like GDPR for EU users.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Significant changes will be communicated via the App or the Google Play Store listing. The updated policy will be effective as of the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document.
