**Last Updated: July 21, 2025**

Rwork, developed by Masud Shafin Ahmed, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("Rwork" or "the App"). Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms, please do not use the App.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

### Personal Information
- **Google Sign-In Data**: When you sign in using your Google account, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture (if available) to authenticate you and personalize your experience.
- **User-Provided Data**: When submitting service requests, you may provide:
  - Name
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Service preferences (e.g., Custom Software, UI/UX, Web, Mobile App Development)
  - Budget details
  - Project descriptions
  - Reference links
- **Admin Data**: If you are an admin, we collect your Google Sign-In data and an "isAdmin" flag to manage access to administrative features.

### Non-Personal Information
- **Usage Data**: We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App, such as navigation patterns, button clicks, and session duration, to improve functionality.
- **Device Information**: We may collect device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers to ensure compatibility and optimize performance.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:
- Authenticate users via Google Sign-In.
- Process and manage service requests (e.g., store request details, update statuses, and send replies).
- Allow admins to view and manage all requests.
- Improve the App’s functionality and user experience through usage analytics.
- Communicate with you, such as responding to service requests or support inquiries.
- Ensure the security and integrity of the App.

## How We Share Your Information

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share your data in the following cases:
- **With Service Providers**: We use third-party services (e.g., Google Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage) that may process your data under strict confidentiality agreements.
- **For Legal Reasons**: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as to comply with a court order or protect our rights.
- **With Admins**: If you submit a service request, your name, email, phone number, and request details are visible to Rwork admins to process your request.

## Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely in Google Firestore, a cloud-based database with industry-standard encryption. We implement reasonable security measures, such as:
- Secure authentication via Google Sign-In.
- Firestore security rules to restrict access to authorized users and admins.
- Regular monitoring for vulnerabilities.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

- **User Data**: We retain your Google Sign-In data (name, email, profile picture) and admin status as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
- **Request Data**: Service request data (e.g., services, budget, description) is retained until you or an admin deletes it, or as required by law.
- **Deletion**: You may request deletion of your data by contacting us at xhafin@gmail.com. We will delete your data within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your personal information:
- **Access**: Request a copy of the data we hold about you.
- **Correction**: Request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your data (subject to legal requirements).
- **Objection**: Object to certain uses of your data, such as analytics.

To exercise these rights, contact us at xhafin@gmail.com or +91 8099103890. We will respond within 30 days.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses:
- **Google Sign-In**: For authentication. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Google Firebase (Firestore)**: For data storage. See [Firebase Privacy Information](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
- **Flutter**: For app development. No personal data is shared with Flutter.

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Children’s Privacy

Rwork is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn such data has been collected, we will delete it immediately.
